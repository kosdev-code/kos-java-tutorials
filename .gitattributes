#
# Manage how Git reads line endings.
# In this project, every text file line should end with only a LF, and never a CR or CR/LF.
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings
#

# Set the default behavior:
* text=auto

# Special handling for KAB files:
*.kab filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Declare files that will always have LF line-endings on checkout:
*.adoc       text eol=lf
*.crt        text eol=lf
*.css        text eol=lf
*.html       text eol=lf
*.key        text eol=lf
*.java       text eol=lf
*.js         text eol=lf
*.json       text eol=lf
*.lst        text eol=lf
*.md         text eol=lf
*.properties text eol=lf
*.sh         text eol=lf
*.svg        text eol=lf
*.ts         text eol=lf
*.txt        text eol=lf
*.xml        text eol=lf

# Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified:
*.cfe   binary
*.cfs   binary
*.class binary
*.der   binary
*.gif   binary
*.lock  binary
*.jar   binary
*.jpeg  binary
*.jpg   binary
